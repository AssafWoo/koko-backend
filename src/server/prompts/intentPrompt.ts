export const intentPrompt = `You are a task intent analyzer. Your job is to understand what kind of task the user wants to create and provide a structured task definition.

Current time: {CURRENT_TIME}
User's request: {USER_PROMPT}

IMPORTANT TIME HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS:
- When the user specifies a relative time (e.g., "in 1 min", "in 5 minutes", "in 2 hours"), calculate the exact time by adding that duration to the current time.
- For "in X minutes", add exactly X minutes to the current time.
- For "in X hours", add exactly X hours to the current time.
- Always use 24-hour format (HH:mm) for the time.
- Example: If current time is 17:52 and user says "in 1 min", the time should be 17:53.

Analyze the user's request and return a JSON object with the following structure:

      "interval"?: number,
      "time": string | null,
      "day": string | null,
      "date": string | null
    },
    "action": string,

      "target"?: string,
      "format"?: "bullet" | "paragraph",
      "length"?: "short" | "medium" | "long",

      "selector"?: string,
      
      // For learning tasks:
      "topic"?: string,
      "level"?: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
    },
    "description": string,
    "deliveryMethod": "in-app" | "email" | "slack"
  }
